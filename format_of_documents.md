
# FORMAT/STANDARDS OF DOCUMENTS

All tutorials must follow all below standards.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 CONTENT

- It is suggested to split paragraphs or text into items. This makes it easier to read and update the sentences.

- All sentences must be short and simple. `Simple English` language of `Wikipedia` can be taken reference.

- There are many `Markdown` languages. In this project, we use only `GitHub Flavored Markdown (⟷ GFM)`, which is supported by `github.com` and `VSCode` by default.

- `Markdown` allows `HTML` and `CSS`. However we do not use them. Because there is no a common standard for which `HTML` element will supported.

- Do not use `>` for code blocks. Always ` ``` ` must be used even for single-line code.

- Do not break the syntax of the programming language as shown in the example below:

  ```java
  void methodA(){
    ...
  }
  ```

  The following must be used:

  ```java
  void methodA(){
    // other code here
  }
  ```

- Do not use words that are not validated by spell-checker.

  Example:

  ```java
  void methodT(){
    
  }
  ```

  The following must be used:

  ```java
  void methodTest(){

  }
  ```

- All files are in `UTF-8` format. But avoid using every `UTF-8` supported characters. Test each character in different input UI components before use it. This is because some characters (especially icons) are not supported by many document viewers/editors. As an example `▇` (full box) character is supported by many viewers/editors. But the length is may different across different viewer/editor. Therefore prefer `#` instead of `▇`.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 BOLD & ITALIC

### 📌📌 BOLD

`Bold` must not be used. Instead the text can be wrapped via `` ` ``.

#### 📌📌📌 Reason for this rule

In the future I may use bold for spesific cases only.

### 📌📌 ITALIC

`Italic` must not be used. Instead the text can be wrapped via `` ` ``.

#### 📌📌📌 Reason for this rule

Italic font can not be easily distinguished on most `Markdown`-viewer.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 DOUBLE AND SINGLE QUOTATION MARK

Double quote and single quote must not be used for below purpose:

wrong usage:

```markdown
"Spring boot" is a Java framework.

'Spring boot' is a Java framework.
```

### 📌📌 Reason for this rule

We already wrap all special text using `` ` ``. That way, all of them will follow the same standard.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 SPECIAL TEXTS

All rules in this title must be followed only for paragraphs.

That means

- comments within the source code
- titles (any level)

should not be follow the rules in this title.

A text (phrase or expression) must be wrapped via `` ` `` only for case which explained in sub-titles below.

### 📌📌 PROPER NAME

If the text is proper name (brand, company name, city name, library name, person name etc).

Correct example:

```markdown
`England` is on `Europe`.
```

### 📌📌 EXAMPLES AND NOTES

Correct examples:

```markdown
`Example`: This is an example.

`Example-1`: This is an example.

`Note`: This is a note.
```

### 📌📌 TECHNICAL TERM

If the text is a technical term.

But for the below terms (and their derivatives and their abbreviations) we must not follow this rule.

- database
- server
- service
- log
- code
- source
- repository
- repo
- IDE
- library
- framework
- login
- logout
- network
- plugin
- extension
- format

Correct example:

```markdown
One `cluster` has multiple `node` instances.
```

### 📌📌 VARIABLE NAMES OR VALUE

If the text is:

- a mathematical variable name or value.
- a programming language or DSL variable name or value.
- a database column name or cell value
- JSON field name or value
- XML tag or value
- YAML key or value
- key or value of `.properties` file

### 📌📌 TEXT WHICH INCLUDES A SPECIAL CHARACTER

If the text contains any character except:

- a-Z

- 0-9

- dash character without space before or after

Correct examples:

```markdown
Some characters like `?` is important.

Start application with `-Dparam1` parameter.

The new syntax is human-readable.

New version is `20.9`.
```

#### 📌📌📌 Reason for this rule

- Paragraphs will be more human-readable.
- spell checker plugin knows that it is a special term.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 ABBREVIATIONS AND SYNONYMS

A term may have abbreviations or synonyms. But:

- abbreviations and synonyms must be mentioned only once (in the same sentence) throughout the entire project.
- we must use the shortest one on rest of the whole repository.

Note: We must use the second shortest, if we have collision.

### 📌📌 Example 1

The abbreviation of `Operating System` is `OS`. We must only use `OS` in whole repository because it is the shortest one.

But we must write only once (a sentence) like below one:

```markdown
`Operating System (⟷ OS)` run other process.
```

### 📌📌 Example 2 (for collision)

The abbreviation of both `Peer-to-peer` and `point--to-point` is `P2P`. This is a collision. Therefore we must never use `P2P` on whole repository.

### 📌📌 Reason for this rule

If the user (who reads the tutorials) selects the term (generally via double-click via mouse)

  - he can search that term quickly where else it is used.
  - viewer (software) highlights the term automatically if it is used elsewhere on the same document.

We use shortest because:

  - Display more information on smaller screens.
  - Take up less space (file size).

</br></br></br>

## 📌 TERMS WRITTEN IN DIFFERENT WAYS

Some terms can be used via dash or white space.

- `Spring boot`
- `Spring-boot`

For those cases only one style of that term must be used throughout the entire repository.

#### 📌📌 Reason for this rule

If the user (who reads the tutorials) selects the term (generally via double-click via mouse)

  - he can search that term quickly where else it is used.
  - viewer (software) highlights the term automatically if it is used elsewhere on the same document.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 FILE SIZE

Each file must be lower than 400 KB.

### 📌📌 Reason for this rule

- `github.com` does not show `Markdown` output (preview) for big files.
- Better performance when editing or reading files (especially from mobile/tablets).
- Some `Markdown` viewers do not show `Title of content` for file which has too many titles.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 REFERENCES (SOURCES)

- There may be missing information (it will always be there anyway), but the accuracy of the available information is very important. If we are not sure about the accuracy of a sentence, it must be mentioned that we have no any sources related to it.

- The source of every simple sentence does not need to be specified in order to prevent the file from becoming too large.

- Each URL (even they are not source of any content) must be archived/cached on `archive.is` and `web.archive.org`.

- All the details about the source file (like title, subtitle), must be written directly inside articles.

- When searching already archived URL from `archive.is` or `web.archive.org` all below combinations should be try:
  - with and without `hashtag` (`#`)
  - `http` or `https`

</br></br></br>

## 📌 EXPORTING TUTORIALS

Do not export/convert files as `PDF` (`A4`) or any portrait-oriented file format.

Prefer `HTML` because it supports landscape tables.

### 📌📌 Reason for this rule

The large tables do not fit on the page.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 TITLE ICON AND LEVELS

Most frequently `Markdown` is rendering to `HTML`. `HTML` accepts only one `H1` item. Therefore only one `H1` title must be use on a file.

All titles must include 📌 (pin) icon depending on its level. Because many HTML does not render the sub-titles very clear (example: they are not bold enough). Also the end user cannot understand which level the subheading is.

- 1st level title must not have any 📌. (This must be the file name)

- 2nd level title must have 1 📌.

- 3rd level title must have 2 📌.

- 4rd level title must have 3 📌.

- If you need 5th subtitle please consider to separate the topics.

No pin or similar icon should ever be used anywhere other than titles.

</br></br></br>

## 📌 TITLE FORMAT

### 📌📌 PREFIX BY LANGUAGE

Abbreviations must have a prefix `abb-tr`, `abb-eng`. Abbreviations must be written in the title.

That makes easier to search with keywords.

But the prefixes are optional. Prefixes (such as `abb-eng`) does not have to be added if not necessary.

- `Example-1`: `app` is abbreviation of `application`. This information is well known.
- `Example-2`: If the title has `Greek` characters then we do not need `gr` prefix.

Valid title examples:

```
eng:application (⟷ abb-eng:app ⟷ tr:uygulama ⟷ gr:πρόγραμμα)
```

```
application (⟷ app ⟷ tr:uygulama ⟷ gr:πρόγραμμα)
```

```
application (⟷ app ⟷ tr:uygulama ⟷ πρόγραμμα)
```

### 📌📌 PROPER NAME

If an abbreviation is abbreviation of a proper name it gets a prefix only: `abb`. Because proper names are independent of any language.

Valid Example:

```
Kubernetes (⟷ abb:K8s)
```

### 📌📌 OLD NAMES

If a title has an older synonym, it gets `old-name` prefix. Example:

```
Solaris (⟷ old-name:SunOS)
```

If a title has an older name, that means the term is proper name. And proper names are independent of any language. Therefor it does not get a language keyword (lile `eng`, `tr`, `gr`).

### 📌📌 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Any information about the title terminology must be written in the first sentence after the title.

### 📌📌 CLOSE MEANINGS

Title must contain exact synonym words. The words in the title must not have close meanings to each other. Otherwise it can be mentioned in the next line.

### 📌📌 USAGE IN PARAGRAPH

If the text has synonym or abbreviation, all of those must be mention on title.

But if that term does not appear in any title (in other words: the term does not have its own title), only then we can use it inside paragraph as below:

```markdown
Firefox is an open source `application (⟷ abb-eng:app ⟷ tr:uygulama)`.
```

As you see it is same as title format. The only difference is that we wrap the term inside `` ` ``.

### 📌📌 VERSION HISTORY

Version lists or tables must have a title which suffixed with `version history`.

Examples:

```text
HTTP version history

Android version history
```

This makes searching standardized.
