## ðŸ“Œ saml version history

`OASIS` Standards:

- `SAML` `1.0` - year 2002
- `SAML` `1.1` - year 2003 - minor changes.
- `SAML` `2.0` - year 2005 - incompatible with older versions.

`The Liberty Alliance` contributed its `Identity Federation Framework (âŸ· ID-FF)`, a fork of `OASIS`:

- `ID-FF` `1.1` - year 2003
- `ID-FF` `1.2` - year 2003 (based on `SAML` `2.0`. but they have critical changes and they are incompatible.)

Although `ID-FF` `1.2` was contributed to `OASIS` as the basis of `SAML` `2.0`, there are some important differences between `SAML` `2.0` and `ID-FF` `1.2`. In particular, the two specifications, despite their common roots, are incompatible.
