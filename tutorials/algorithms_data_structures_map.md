## ðŸ“Œ Map

Working mechanism of structures like `HashSet`, `HashMap` which are based on `hash` are explained to another topic (at the topic about `hashcode`).

The `Map` interface of `Java` does not have any super class. It defined as:

```java
Map<Class1, Class2>
```

For each `Class1` object, there should be `Class2` object. It stores the data as key-value. Some implementations of `Map`:

- __HashMap__: It does not guarantees the order of a `for loop` which will be based on `keySet()` method.

- __LinkedHashMap__: It guarantees the order of a `for loop` which will be based on `keySet()` method. It orders the data in sequence of data insertion method call. In order to do that It implements the HashMap and additionally it use doubly linked list to store the order under the hood.

- __TreeMap__: It guarantees the order based on below techniques.

  - __java.lang.Comparable__

    The data classes which implemented this interface, have to implemented `int compareTo(object1)` method. `TreeMap` uses that method to sort the classes.

    In `Java` articles we can see the `natural ordering` term. This term is using only for classes which implemented `Comparable`.

  - __java.util.Comparator__

    We create a class which implements this interface with `int compare(object1, object2)` method.

    This class is not implementing by any class which is storing on `Map`. `Comparator` implementation is a separated class from our data classes. It is an external class.

- __IdentityHashMap__: It has 2 main differences with `HashMap`:
  - 1- `HashMap` uses `equals` method to compare the data which putted inside. But instead of that `IdentityHashMap` uses `==` (reference compare).
  - 2- `HashMap` use `hashCode` method, but `IdentityHashMap` uses `System.identityHashCode(object)` method which return the default `hashCode` which would be returning if the class hadn't override `hashCode`.

## ðŸ“Œ SortedMap

It's an interface which implements `Map`. It is using by order matter classes.

## ðŸ“Œ HashTable

`HashTable` is a general data structure term. The corresponding class on `Java` is `HashMap`.

But specifically for the `Java` world, there is a class named as `HashTable`. difference between `HashMap` vs `HashTable`: `java.util.Hashtable` class is `thread-safe`, while `java.util.HashMap` is not.

It is slow to add elements because it calculates the hash code of each object but lookup is fast.

## ðŸ“Œ EnumMap

It only accepts `Java` `Enum` for the key side.
