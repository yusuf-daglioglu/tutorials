## ðŸ“Œ Ã§izge (âŸ· graph âŸ· tr:graf âŸ· Ã§izit)

- Any `node` may have a connection to any `node` (even circular).
- For example: `A` `node` can be connected to 10 other `nodes`. In the same `graph` another `node` may connect only 1 `node`.

Some terms:

- __vertex (plural vertices) âŸ· node (âŸ· dÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼m)__: `vertex`; `tepe noktasÄ±` anlamÄ±na gelir.
- __edge__: Each connection of a specific `node`.
- __Order__: The number of `vertices` in the `graph`.
- __Size__: The number of `edges` in the `graph`.
- __vertex degree (âŸ· dÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼mÃ¼n derecesi)__: number of `edges` of a `vertex`.
- __isolated vertex__: a `vertex` which does not have any connections(`edges`) to other `vertices`.
- __self loop__: an `edge` from `vertex` to itself.
- __undirected graph__: In this type of graph there is no direction information for `edges`. In another word; if `X` `node` have connection to `Y` `node`, `Y` `node` also must have connection to `X`. The opposite `graph` type is __directed graph__ which has direction information.
- __komÅŸuluk matrisi (âŸ· adjacency matrix)__: This takes more memory. But it is fast to find the connections.

```text
   A B C

A  0 1 0

B  1 1 1

C  0 1 1
```

- __komÅŸuluk listesi (âŸ· adjacency list)__: Requires low memory. But it takes long time to find the relations between `node`s. Also it is more complex comparing `adjacency matrix`.

```text
A -> {B}

B -> {C, D}
```

The above `adjacency list` means:

- There is a connection from `A` to `B`.
- There is a connection from `B` to `C` and `D`.

## ðŸ“Œ real use case examples of graph

- storing the physical border connections between countries and cities.
- Storing the list of friend connections on social media web sites
- connections of between atoms/molecules (for simulation)
- connections between devices for electronic circuit (for simulation or on engineering design tools)
- connections of each part on puzzle game
- `Google`'s `PageRank` algorithm. In this algorithm, `Google` stores which web page has linked by which web pages. If a web page has reference (link) inside other web pages, that means the web page reputation is high.
- network topology. It seems like, the network is based on tree structure. But it's not. Because of 2 reasons:
  - the child `node`s (the computers) can send directly message to each other. They use the router (parent) only to detect the `IP` address of each other.
  - A computer (`node`) can has multiple routers (parents) if the computer use multiple network devices.
