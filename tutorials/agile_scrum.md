## ðŸ“Œ Systems development life cycle (âŸ· SDLC âŸ· application development life-cycle)

It's a general term for all below titles.

## ðŸ“Œ Ã‡evik proje yÃ¶netimi (âŸ· Agile project management)

It's a type of project (not necessarily software project) management. It's suitable for projects which:

- not have well defined requirements,
- are open for change,
- are complex.

`Agile` manifesto is as following:

`Turkish`:

```text
Bizler daha iyi yazÄ±lÄ±m geliÅŸtirme yollarÄ±nÄ±

uygulayarak ve baÅŸkalarÄ±nÄ±n da uygulamasÄ±na yardÄ±m ederek ortaya Ã§Ä±kartÄ±yoruz.

Bu Ã§alÄ±ÅŸmalarÄ±n sonucunda:

SÃ¼reÃ§ler ve araÃ§lardan ziyade bireyler ve etkileÅŸimlere

KapsamlÄ± dÃ¶kÃ¼mantasyondan ziyade Ã§alÄ±ÅŸan yazÄ±lÄ±ma

SÃ¶zleÅŸme pazarlÄ±klarÄ±ndan ziyade mÃ¼ÅŸteri ile iÅŸbirliÄŸine

Bir plana baÄŸlÄ± kalmaktan ziyade deÄŸiÅŸime karÅŸÄ±lÄ±k vermeye

deÄŸer vermeye kanaat getirdik.

Ã–zetle, sol taraftaki maddelerin deÄŸerini kabul etmekle birlikte,

saÄŸ taraftaki maddeleri daha deÄŸerli bulmaktayÄ±z.
```

`English`:

```text
We are uncovering better ways of developing

software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on

the right, we value the items on the left more.

## ðŸ“Œ Scrum

kelime anlamÄ±: itiÅŸip kakÄ±ÅŸma, saldÄ±rÄ±

There is no any special word in `Turkish` for `Agile`.

It's an implementation of the `Agile`. It defines the terms like `sprint` (kelime anlamÄ±: sÃ¼rat koÅŸusu), `backlog` (kelime anlamÄ±: rezerv, birikim), `daily meetings` etc. It is designed only for software projects.

Generally `Scrum` defines more details about the management process. But `Agile` is set of abstract principles comparing to `Scrum`. Some examples to understand that difference:

- `Agile` defines that face to face communication is required. But `Scrum` defines that the customers should work with `developers`.
- `Agile` defines the iterations, but `Scrum` defines the `sprint`.
- `Agile` points out that visualizing is important, but `Scrum` defines `scrum board`.

Analysis had to be sent to `developers` before `sprint` starts. The developers should read the analysis after the retrospective meeting and before giving them story points.

`Scrum`'s guide is being updated. Changes are made in the flow and phrases. The 2020 version is here:

`(source-id: 81)`

`(source-id: 82)`

Other versions are here: `(source-id: 83)`

## ðŸ“Œ Scrum terms

## ðŸ“Œ Scrum people

- __Scrum master__
  - He is responsible and manages the `Scrum` progress.
  - He also solves the non-technical issues which blocks the `team`.

- __project manager (âŸ· proje yÃ¶neticisi)__
  - In some `Agile` systems this person has been defined.
  - But there is no any term as `project manager`, if we talk specific to `Scrum`.

- __team leader (âŸ· takÄ±m lideri)__
  There is no role like this at `Scrum`. Because the team is `self-organized`.

- __Scrum team__
  Consist of:
  - `PO`
  - `Scrum master`
  - `development team`

- __stakeholder__
  - A person except the `scrum team`.

  may consist of:

  - customers/ends users

  - company members of customers and `scrum team`'s company (like CEO, CTO)

  - Sales/Marketing teams of developed product

  - support teams

- `development team`
  - In 2020, the term update as `developers`.
  - Those people are only the people who develop the software. They should not be separated as subgroups. If they should separate, these subgroups should be independent `Scrum` teams. Analysts and testers also they should be separated groups.
  - It is not recommended to be less then 3 or more then 9 people.

- __product owner (âŸ· PO âŸ· Ã¼rÃ¼n sahibi)__
  - After all decisions and researches, he has the responsibility to decide which tasks should be develop in the next `sprint`.
  - `PO` is constantly in contact with customer.
  - He understands the requirements of customers and he sets the business points on each task on backlog.
  - He also writes the details on each task.
  - He don't have to be a technical person. He focuses only on business.
  - `PO` can let the `development team` to do his jobs. But in this case, `PO` is still the responsible of those things.
  - `PO` is the only person who can decide the cancellation of `Sprint`. But the `stakeholders`, `Scrum master` and the `developer team` are effective to making this decision. If the `Sprint` will cancel, all the remaining tasks in that `Sprint` will be reviewed and the required meetings should be planned to start the new `Sprint`.
  - At the end of the `Sprint` the DEMO should be present to `PO`.

## ðŸ“Œ Scrum events

Each meeting/event should be done on predefined time (time-boxed).

  - At the end of the `sprint`, `developer team` and the `Scrum master` joins in this meeting and they are talking about success and the failures.
  - Both technical and non-technical topics (like `Scrum` process) can be discuss. But most ideally it is recommended to discuss only about non-technical topics (like `Scrum` process).
  - No matter how successful the last `sprint` was, this meeting should be scheduled. Otherwise there will be no improvement.
  - It should take maximum 3 hours for 1 month `Sprint`. For shorter `sprint`, this meeting should be shorter.

    - what problems we encountered?
  - This meeting should be scheduled before `Sprint Planning` and after `Sprint Review`.

- __Product Backlog refinement__
  - refinement kelime anlamÄ±: iyileÅŸtirme.
  - `grooming` means: prepare or train (someone) for a particular purpose or activity.
  - Term __Grooming__ replaced as `refinement` with official `scrum guide` 2013.
  - This meeting is defined in official `Scrum Guide`, but it's not under `scrum event` topic.
  - In this meeting `development team` set story points and details for each task item.

## ðŸ“Œ Other terms for Scrum

- __Planning poker (âŸ· Scrum poker)__
  - It's a technique which is using when `developer` team set the story points for each task. Every `developer` shows their story points using cards (some kind of poker card).
  - It's not an official term defined in `Scrum Guide`.

- __Ã§apraz fonksiyonlu takÄ±m (âŸ· cross-functional team)__

  - Is a term that officially defined in `Scrum Guide`.

- __business Value__

  - The value is setting by `PO`.
  - Is not a term that officially defined in `Scrum Guide`.

- __Story points__
  - Is the number is the combination of both complexity and estimation (time) of a task.
  - The value is like "__Normalized Value__" on statistics. It does not have a unit. It is a value given by team via old experiences. The team compares the old tasks with the current (new) one.
  - The values can be Fibonacci-like numbers: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.
  - High values should not be given to tasks. If it should have high value, then the tasks should be divided.
  - Bug and technical tasks also should have story points. Because they are validating by `PO` and they are developing in the `sprint`.
  - Is not a term that officially defined in `Scrum Guide`.

- __story point vs hour__
  - The team not always estimate the tasks correctly. For that reason, a technique called `story point` designed as an alternative way to calculation of tasks.
  - `story point` based on comparing technique. On each new `sprint`, the team gives the new point on the new tasks by comparing the old tasks.
  - Experienced project managers observed that the story points are reflect more accurate comparing to estimated hours.

- __Estimation__
  - The time value for 1 developer to complete the task.
  - It's not a term which defined in `Scrum Guide`.

  - Some of tasks may have a research phase. Maybe the team will decide which framework/library they will use to develop a feature. In that cases a new tasks should be created for the research phase. This task is named "spike".

## ðŸ“Œ The Chicken and the Pig

It is a business fable. It was also mentioned in the official `Scrum Guide` but it has been removed on the new versions.

The chicken and pig decided to open a restaurant. They both should serve a food to customer as partners. The chicken had to serve his eggs and the pig had to serve meat which will be part of itself. In the bottom line; The Chicken is involved, but the Pig commits. This situation is simulated on `Scrum` framework as: the `Development Team`, `PO`s & `Scrum Master`s are considered as people who are committed to the project while `stakeholders`, customers and executive management are considered as involved but not committed to the project.

## ðŸ“Œ Kanban

- It's an implementation of `Agile`.
- The main focus of `Kanban` is the visualization of tasks. So everyone can see an predict the failures.
- Below are the differences between `Kanban` comparing to `Scrum`:
  - There are no specific meeting and activity definitions on `Kanban`. But on any bottlenecks the team decides to any new action. On each project the progress improves itself.
  - On `Kanban`, to giving estimations is optional.
  - On `Kanban`, there is no definitions of roles (like `Scrum Master` etc).
  - On `Kanban`, the iteration is optional. On `Agile`, the `iteration` is mandatory and it's equals to `sprint`.

## ðŸ“Œ Extreme programming (âŸ· XP)

- It's an implementation of `Agile`. It designed only for software projects.
- Below factors have high priority on `XP`:
  - quality of code is important. Therefore in some cases refactoring tasks has high priority.
  - `Test-driven development`
  - `YAGNI`
  - Small releases
  - Simple design

## ðŸ“Œ WaterFall Model (âŸ· Åželale modeli)

- It's not a implementation of `Agile`.
- Code of entire project is designing after the analysis. The analysis should be ready completely.
- In most cases it is not eligible in current era. Because to prepare all analysis takes really long time and in that preparing period, customer needs may change. Also sometimes the customer does not know what we wants. At `Scrum`, the customer follows/joins the development progress and demonstrations of each `sprint`. So he can see whats going on, and he can make decisions on the development period.
- Whole project can be separated in steps/periods. In this case, end of each these periods called `milestone` (kilometre taÅŸÄ±, dÃ¶nÃ¼m noktasÄ±)

- Very first usage of `Lean product development` is the name of the culture of production environment of `Toyota` fabric. After that, a book has been written in 2003 called `lean software development` which adapt this culture to software project.
- `Lean software development` generally based on `YAGNI` and optimized development systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Spotify model

terim olarak Ã§ok farklÄ± anlaÅŸÄ±labilmektedir. Piyasada farklÄ± isimleri var:

- `Spotify Organizasyonel Modeli`
- `Spotify Agile Organizasyon Modeli`
- `Squad Framework`

2012'de "`Scaling Agile with Tribes, Squads, Chapters & Guilds @Spotify`" makalesinde public olarak anlatÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸtÄ±r.

`Spotify` ÅŸirketinin kendi iÃ§inde kullandÄ±ÄŸÄ± SDLC'dir.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ Squad

tÃ¼rkÃ§e kelime anlamÄ±: ekip.

`Scrum`'daki team'e Ã§ok benzeyen bir yapÄ±. kendi iÃ§inde `Kanban`, `Agile` veya farklÄ± bir framework kullanabilir.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ Tribe

`tÃ¼rkÃ§e` kelime anlamÄ±: takÄ±m. meslek grubu.

Birbiri ile iliÅŸkili `Squad`'larÄ± birbiri ile uyumunu saÄŸlamakla gÃ¶revli takÄ±m.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ Ã¶rnek

e-ticaret sitesinde:

`squad-1`: arama motoru ve front-end'deki Ã¶nyÃ¼z component'i.

`squad-2`: Ã¼rÃ¼n detayÄ± sayfalarÄ±.

`tribe`: squad 1 ve 2'nin uyumu iÃ§in Ã§alÄ±ÅŸan ekip. bu ekipte bu kiÅŸiler var:

- `Tribe Lead` (1 kiÅŸi)
- `squad lead` (her `Squad`'dan 1 kiÅŸi)
- duruma gÃ¶re `project manager` tarzÄ± kiÅŸiler olabilir.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ takÄ±mlarÄ±n baÄŸÄ±msÄ±zlÄ±ÄŸÄ±

`Squad`'lar diÄŸer `Squad`'lardan baÄŸÄ±msÄ±z olmalÄ±. fakat bu pratikte pek olmuyor. ama `tribe`'lar da diÄŸer `tribe`'lardan baÄŸÄ±msÄ±z olmalÄ±. `Tribe`'larÄ±n baÄŸÄ±msÄ±zlÄ±ÄŸÄ± daha Ã¼stÃ¼ne dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼lebilen(dÃ¼zeltilebilen) bir konu. Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ 1 `tribe`'daki 1 `squad` diÄŸer `tribe`'dan bir `squad`'a baÄŸÄ±mlÄ±ysa, ilgili `squad` ilgili `tribe`'a taÅŸÄ±nabilir.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ operasyon ekibi yok

`spotify`'da operasyon ekibi var, ama bu ekip, `squad`'lar kendi baÅŸÄ±na deploy alÄ±p, kendi baÅŸlarÄ±na operasyonlarÄ± alabilmeleri iÃ§in onlara yardÄ±mcÄ± olmaktadÄ±r. operasyon ekibi, deployment yapmamaktadÄ±r.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ chapter

aynÄ± `tribe` iÃ§indeki tÃ¼m testÃ§iler, veya FE'lerin kendi iÃ§inde oluÅŸturduÄŸu takÄ±mdÄ±r. bu takÄ±m birbirine bilgi aktarÄ±r. eÄŸer bu olmazsa, birbirlerinin yaptÄ±ÄŸÄ± iyi ve kÃ¶tÃ¼ ÅŸeyleri birbirlerine Ã¶neremezler.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ guild

tÃ¼rkÃ§e kelime anlamÄ±: sendika.

`chapter` ile aynÄ± amaÃ§tadÄ±r. farklarÄ±:

- farklÄ± `tribe`'lerden katÄ±lÄ±m olabilir.
- farklÄ± teknolojilerden katÄ±lÄ±m olabilir. mesela 3 FE, 1 BE birleÅŸip `DTO` standartlarÄ±na karar vermesi gibi bir ekip olabilir.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ sistem sahibi (âŸ· System Owner)

`Spotify` modelinin riski, hiÃ§ kimse sistemin bir bÃ¼tÃ¼n olarak entegre olmasÄ±na odaklanmaz ise, sistemin altyapÄ±sÄ±nÄ±n bozulmasÄ±dÄ±r.

`spotify`'da ortalama 200 kiÅŸi varken 2 kiÅŸi bu roldeydi.

bu sebeple; 2 `sistem sahibi` var. biri daha Ã§ok operasyonel, diÄŸer development konularÄ±na odaklÄ±dÄ±r. ortalama zamanÄ±nÄ±n yÃ¼zde 10'larÄ±nÄ± sistemi inceleyip, kod kalitesi, dÃ¶kÃ¼mantasyon, teknik borÃ§, gibi mimarisel konulara odaklanÄ±r. kala %90 zamanÄ±nda `squad`'Ä±n bir parÃ§asÄ± veya `chapter lead` olmak zorundadÄ±r.

### ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ chief architect

1 kiÅŸidir.

`spotify`'da ortalama 200 kiÅŸi varken 1 kiÅŸi bu roldeydi.

`Matris model`inde, Ahmet 2 kiÅŸiden emir alÄ±yor:

- proje a yÃ¶neticisi
- mÃ¼hendislik yÃ¶neticisi

Ama klasik modelde Ahmet sadece mÃ¼hendislik yÃ¶neticisinden emir alÄ±yor. Proje A yÃ¶neticisi bu modelde sadece koordine eden oluyor.

Klasik Modelin AvantajlarÄ±:

- YÃ¶netim ve komuta net, basit.
- Rol ve sorumluluklar aÃ§Ä±k.
- iletiÅŸim kolay.

dezavantajlar:

- Projeler arasÄ± iÅŸ birliÄŸi zayÄ±f.
- Yenilik ve hÄ±z kÄ±sÄ±tlÄ±.

```text
As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships

YÃ¼ksek emeller peÅŸinde koÅŸan YazÄ±lÄ±m UstalarÄ± olarak bizler, profesyonel yazÄ±lÄ±m geliÅŸtirme Ã§Ä±tasÄ±nÄ±, bizzat uygulayarak ve baÅŸkalarÄ±nÄ±n bu mesleÄŸi Ã¶ÄŸrenmelerine yardÄ±m ederek yÃ¼kseltiyoruz. Bu Ã§alÄ±ÅŸmalarÄ±n sonucunda: 

Sadece Ã§alÄ±ÅŸan yazÄ±lÄ±ma deÄŸil, ustaca Ã¼retilmiÅŸ yazÄ±lÄ±ma da
Sadece deÄŸiÅŸikliÄŸe cevap vermeye deÄŸil, sÃ¼rekli deÄŸer katmaya da
Sadece bireylere ve etkileÅŸimlere deÄŸil, profesyoneller topluluÄŸuna da
Sadece mÃ¼ÅŸteri ile iÅŸbirliÄŸine deÄŸil, Ã¼retken ortaklÄ±ÄŸa da

DeÄŸer vermeye kanaat getirdik. Sol taraftaki maddeleri takip etmekle birlikte, saÄŸ taraftaki maddeleri vazgeÃ§ilmez bulmaktayÄ±z.
